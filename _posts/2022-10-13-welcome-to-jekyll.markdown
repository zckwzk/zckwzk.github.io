Notes: This first post is a default post when we build static web using jekyll, i don't delete it because maybe i can look at it again in the future if need to. I choose jekyll because i used to create one before, it simple to setup for github page, i can use either html or markdown out of the box, and it can also be costumize if i need to. 

I am using Huawei Matepad 11 and termux to setup jekyll on the local android environment. Why bother using tablet when I have a laptop, well.. I think its a nostalgic to using terminal like in linux  again, and its quite challenging to see how far i can use the tablet as my device to program thing.

If you also like to use jekyll on android device, here thing you may want  to know

* Install using Jekyll version 3, the newest version (4) will give error of some postcss thing.
* You will still get error of permission when serve jekyll (don't be panic, there are many reference to solve it)
* It can be done.

--DEFAULT FIRST POST

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
